# Challenge Project: Research White Paper

## Final submission due on or before December 1

## Description

Write a short paper investigating an emerging computer science technology and its implications for broader society. 
Your write-up will be in the form of a white paper, or executive report, written to inform a decision maker about an issue.

To write your paper, choose a technology and an area of application. For example, you might be interested in Bitcoin and blockchain,
the underlying technology behind most cryptocurrencies. You could then pick an aspect of society that might be impacted by blockchain over the
next 10-15 years: finance, education, voting, there are lots of possible ideas.

Once you have a topic and an impact area, your goal is to **research** the intersection and produce a **concise overview** that you
would give to an executive or policy maker to inform them about the potential impacts of the technology over the next 5-15 years. Your
write-up should probably cover

- Why is technology *X* important for *Y*? Why should people care?
- Basic technical background in plain language: what does technology *X* do?
- How much adoption of this technology has already taken place? Are there real products on the market being used by paying customers, or is it more speculative?
- What are the potential medium term benefits and drawbacks of technology *X* in area *Y*?
- How should firms and policy makers respond?

## Topic Ideas

You can pick a topic that you're interested in, but here are some ideas to get you started:

- Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain technology (many possible applications to investigate, but make sure you do research to go beyond the hype)
- Self-driving cars (again, many possible topics, but go beyond surface-level hype)
- The role of facial recognition technology and "social credit score" in China
- The Great Firewall of China and Internet censorship
- Predictive policing and the use of AI in the justice system
- Issues of bias introduced by predictive algorithms
- The use of AI as a teaching tool in K-12 schools and colleges
- Data protection and the EU's GDPR law
- "Right to be forgotten" and its implications for web search
- Mental health impacts of social media
- Automation and its implications for employment and the concept of a universal basic income
- Deep fakes

**Be specific**!

- "The impact of AI on business" is too broad and, frankly, boring. What kind of AI? What sorts of businesses?

- "The impact of AI chess programs on high-level competitive chess" is much more interesting. How has the chess changed now that
computers are better than any human player and humans can use AI programs for training and planning? The specificity of the question 
makes it meaningful.

**Pick a specific, focused question that you honestly think is interesting and write about that**. If you don't have one in mind right 
away, do some general background reading and thinking to start coming up with ideas. **Give your ideas time to develop**!

Your topic doesn't have to be about a big social issue or problem. "Small" issues that you care about, like the chess example above, are guaranteed to be more interesting.

You can also start with a big area, like "business", and then narrow it down. How about small businesses? Or family-owned farms? Real estate? By getting more specific, you create opportunities for targeted research, which then helps you refine your ideas even further.


## Grade Contribution

Successfully completing this project will raise your final grade by **one half of a letter**. For example, if your grade before completing
the project was a B, you'll have a B+ after receiving credit for the project.

This extra credit stacks with the other challenge projects you complete. There will be at least two challenge programming projects and an
opportunity to complete an in-depth reflective writing exercise: each of those projects will also increase your grade by one-half of a
letter.

## Annotated Bibliography

Rather than giving detailed citations in the text, you can include references for all of your factual information in a one-page annotated
bibliography. For each entry, list

- The title of the work
- The author(s), if applicable
- The publication where it appeared, if applicable
- A 1-3 sentence summary of the article, giving its main points and why you used it as background for your paper.

**You don't need to include links for web resources**. Just list the name of the site or publication where the article appeared.
For articles published in academic journals, list the name of the journal.

## Formatting, Etc.

Write a three-page paper using normal one-inch margins, 12 pt. font (Times New Roman or similar), and 1.5 line spacing. I don't care about
the particular details of the format you use as long as you don't do anything goofy.

The annotated bibliography should be **one page with at least four sources**. Four good, informative sources from high-quality venues
is more than enough.

## Submission

Upload your paper and annotated bibliography to the assignment that I'll create on the course Canvas page. You have until **December 1**
to finalize your submission.

## Grading

I'll mark your paper in the following categories:

- Clear statement of the issue at hand: why is it important to understand the impact of technology *X* on area *Y*?
- Brief summary of technology in plain language.
- Discussion of potential impacts over the next 5-15 years and what decision makers can do about them.
- Grammar, formatting, etc.
- One-page annotated bibliography listing background citations and a 1-3 sentence summary of each one.

Each area will be marked **satisfactory or unsatisfctory**. If your first submission is not satisfactory in any area, you'll have **one
opportunity to revise it**, with the requirement that the final version must still be submitted on or before December 1.
