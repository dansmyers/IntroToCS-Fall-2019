# Exam Review Questions

## Description

This is the final exam study guide. I will select about 15 questions from the lists below, exactly as they appear, to be the content of 
the final exam.

## Loops

1. Write a loop that adds up all of the negative integers greater than -1000 and divisible by 3 or 5.

2. Write three different loops that each print `s m o k e t h e s e m e a t s` 100 times.

3. Write a code fragment that prints a 12 x 15 multiplication table.

4. Write a code fragment that prints the numbers from 1 to 30, but print `Bink!` for numbers divisible by 4, `Bonk!` for numbers 
divisible by 7, and `BinkBonk!` for numbers divisible b both 4 and 7.

5. Write a program that uses a `while` loop and a `Scanner` to continually prompt the user for input.  The program should continue looping until the user types one of the following words:

```
nitwit
blubber
oddment
tweak
```

## Methods

1. Print `OHAI` 9 times without using a loop and using only one `System.out.println` statement.

2. Write a method that takes a `double` value as input and returns its absolute value. Do not use `Math.abs`.

3. Whatâ€™s the difference between a static and non-static method? Why are static methods not allowed to access object instance variables?

4. Write a method that returns the sum of two randomly generated die rolls.

5. Write a method called `isPrime` that takes an `int` as input and returns `true` if the `int` is prime.

6. Consider the following method. What is `weird(weird(weird(15)))`?

```
public static int weird (int n) {

    if (n % 2 == 0) {
        return n / 2;
    } else {
        return 3 * n + 1;
    }
    
}
```

## Arrays

1. Write a code fragment that initializes an `int[]` containing the first 7 prime numbers then prints its contents using the enhanced
`for` loop.

2. Write a method that takes a `double[]` as input and returns the average of the numbers it contains.

3. Write a method called `noVowels` that takes a `String` as input and returns `true` if it doesn't contain any vowels (a, e, i, o, u).

4. Write a method called `isPalindrome` that takes a `String` as input and returns true if the `String` is a palindrome.

5. Give an example where `==` and `.equals` return different results. Explain your answer.

6. Give an example where `==` and `.equals` return the same result. Explain your answer.

7. What is the output of this fragment? Explain.  

```
char c = 'A';
System.out.println(c + 10);
```
8. Write a method called `isSorted` that takes an array as input and returns `true` if the array's elements are in increasing order.

9. Consider the following operation, applied to an arbitrary positive integer  

- if the integer is even, divide it by two
- if the integer is odd, multiply it by three and add one

Now, create a sequence based on this operation.  Starting with a given input integer, apply the operation to generate a second integer, then apply the operation to that number to create a third value, and so forth.  For example, starting with 6 generates the following sequence  

```
6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
```

This sequence of values is known as the *hailstone sequence*. The Collatz conjecture, named after Lothar Collatz, states that a sequence 
generated by this rule will eventually end in 1 for any positive integer starting value.  

Write a method named `collatz` that takes an `int` named `n` as input and uses a `while` loop to print the hailstone sequence starting at `n` and terminating at 1.

## Objects

1. Define the concept of encapsulation in object-oriented programming. Answer in the form of a haiku.

2. What is the difference between a `public` and a `private` data member. Again, answer in the form of a haiku.

3. What is the difference between a class and a instance of a class?

4. Write a `Circle` class with a `private double radius` parameter. Your class should have a constructor, an `area` method, and a `toString` method.

5. Write a `Student` class with a `String name` and `double gpa` class members. Write a constructor, `get` and `set` methods, and a 
`toString` method.

## Miscellaneous

1. Use a truth table to show that `!(A && B && C)` is equalivalent to `!A || !B || !C`. This is one version of De Morgen's Law, an important result in Boolean logic.
