# We Use Computers To Make Videogames

## Description

This lab will introduce the amazing world of **graphical output**. We'll be able to write programs that **make things appear on the screen**. In a few more days, we'll learn about taking input from the keyboard and using it to control our graphical creations.

To implement this, we're going to introduce two more tools. The first is a library called `StdDraw.java`, which includes a bunch of basic drawing methods. The second is a different editor called *BlueJ*. It's technically possible to use Codio for graphics, but it's complicated and doesn't work on every platform. BlueJ runs on your local computer.

## Get BlueJ

Go to [www.bluej.org](the BlueJ homepage). Download the appropriate version for your operating system (Mac or Windows). Open the ZIP file into a location that you can remember. Click on the BlueJ logo to launch the program.

The first thing you need to do is create a **project**. From the main BlueJ screen, go to Project --> New Project. In the panel that appears, use the "Choose" button to select a directory where you want to put your BlueJ projects. Then type a name for the project like `CMS_167_Graphics_Lab` and hit OK.

## Classes

Step 1: import `StdDraw.java`. Go on to Blackboard
