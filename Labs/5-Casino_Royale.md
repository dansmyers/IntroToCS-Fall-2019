# Casino Royale

## Overview

Our goal for today's lab is to begin working on your next project: an electronic casino program.

Here's how it will work:

- The user is presented with a menu of game choices and picks one.

- Each game has an associated method, which implements all of the behaviors and rules for the game.

- There will also be a few support methods to handle generating random numbers, etc.

Here is an example of one complete run of the program:

```
Welcome to the Casino!
1. Even-Odd
2. Slots
3. Matching Pennies
4. Sic Bo
5. 
Please select a game:
1

Welcome to Even-Odd!
I'll roll two dice and check if their sum is even or odd.
If that matches your bet, you win!
1. Even
2. Odd
Please select a bet:
1
The dice are 3 and 5.
You win!
```

I'll give you the complete specs and rules for each game when the next project is assigned. Our goal for today is to lay out the basic 
structure of the program and complete the first game.
