# Exam Review Questions

## Description

These are practice exam review questions that will be on the final study guide. **The complete guide will be released before our last lab on Thursday**.

## Loops

1. Write a loop that adds up all of the negative integers greater than -1000 and divisible by 3 or 5.

2. Write three different loops that each print `s m o k e t h e s e m e a t s` 100 times.

3. Write a code fragment that prints a 12 x 12 multiplication table.

4. Write a code fragment that prints the numbers from 1 to 30, but print `Bink!` for numbers divisible by 4, `Bonk!` for numbers divisible
by 7, and `BinkBonk!` for numbers divisible by 4 and 7.

5. Write code fragment that repeatedly prompts the user for a message until the user types `STOP`.

## Methods

1. Print `OHAI` 100 times without using a loop and without using 100 print statements.

2. Write a method that takes a `double` value as input and returns its absolute value.

3. Whatâ€™s the difference between a static and non-static method?

4. What is the output of this fragment?

```
char c = 'A';
System.out.println(c + 10);
```

## Arrays

1. Initialize an `int[]` containing the first 7 prime numbers.

2. Write a method that takes a `double[]` as input and returns the average of the numbers it contains.

3. Write a method called `noVowels` that takes a `String` as input and returns `true` if it doesn't contain any vowels (a, e, i, o, u).

4. Write a method called `isPalindrome` that takes a `String` as input and returns true if the `String` is a palindrome.

5. Give an example where `==` and `.equals` return different results.

6. Give an example where `==` and `.equals` return the same result.

## Objects

1. Define the concept of encapsulation in object-oriented programming. Answer in the form of a haiku.

2. What is the difference between a `public` and a `private` data member. Again, answer in the form of a haiku.

3. What is the difference between a class and a instance of a class?

4. Write a `Circle` class with a `private double radius` parameter. Your class should have a constructor, an `area` method, and a `toString` method.

5. Write a `Student` class with a `String name` and `double gpa` class members. Write a constructor, `get` and `set` methods, and a 
`toString` method.
