# Method Practice Problems

## Is It Me You're Looking For?

Write a program named `Hello100.java` that contains four methods:

- `sayHello`, which will print `Hello!` to the screen.
- `sayHello5Times`, which calls `sayHello` five times.
- `sayHello25Times`, which calls `sayHello5Times`.
- `sayHello100Times`, which calls `sayHello25Times`.

All of the methods should have the return type `void`, because they do not `return` any values.

Here is the class definition and `main`:

```
public class Hello100 {

    //*** Put method definitions above main ***//

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        sayHello100Times();
    }

}
```
