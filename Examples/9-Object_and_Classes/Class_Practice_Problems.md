# Practice Writing Classes

## Guitar

Write a Java class named `Guitar` with the following `private` data members:

- `String maker`
- `String model`
- `boolean isPointy`
- `int year`
- `int volume`

Write a constructor that initializes all five values and `get` methods for all five values. Write a `set` method for the `volume` attribute that allows the user to set the volume to an `int` between 0 and 11, including both.

Give your class a `toString` method that prints a `String` representation of the object's data.

*Such points. Much shred.*

## More Points

Moving from the realm of pointy guitars to actual points, write a class called `Point2D` to represent a single point in two-dimensional space.

Your class should have to `private double` data members named `x` and `y`.

Write a constructor, `set` and `get` methods for both members, and a `toString` method.
