Arithmetic and Operators Practice Problems
==========================================

Warm-Up
-------
Write a program that prints

```
You are an excellent programmer, NAME.
```

where NAME is your name.


Calculate
---------
Write a program that performs the following calculation and prints the
result

```
2 + 8     20 - 5 
-----  +  ------
  2          3
```

Pool Party
----------
The world's largest swimming pool is at the San Alfonso del Mar resort
in Chile. It measures 3323 feet long, covers 20 acres, and contains
about 66 million US gallons of water.

A firkin is a somewhat archaic unit of measure that is sometimes used
to measure beer and ale in Britain. The British Imperial beer firkin
is defined to be equal to 10.8 US gallons.

Suppose we wanted to fill the San Alfonso del Mar pool with beer,
because reasons. How many firkins of beer would be required to
accomplish this feat?


Should Have Bought Ten Years Ago
--------------------------------
As of this morning, 1 Bitcoin is trading for $10,166.50.

How many dollars could I obtain for my measly .05 BTC?


Circle
------
What is the area of a circle with radius 5.0?


Division Bell
--------------
Calculate 15 / 4 using Java. What did you get? Is that right?

Try another one: 21 / 5. What does Java give? What is the correct
answer?

What does Java do if you divide two whole numbers? Try some more
examples if you need to.

**ANSWER THE QUESTION BEFORE READING AHEAD**

Java makes a distinction between integer division, where both
arguments are whole numbers, and regular division, where at least
one number contains a decimal point.

When you divide two integers, Java always truncates the result,
rounding it down towards zero.

Try calculating 15.0 / 4 and 15 / 4.0 and verify that those
expressions yield the correct answers.


Number Fail
-----------
Try the following calculation. Does it yield the EXACT correct result?

```
System.out.println(.1 + .2);
```

Java must store all of its data in a real physical computer. Because
of the limitations of the physical machine, the data types used to
represent fractional numbers may have very small errors, which can
lead to tiny inaccuracies in calculations involving decimal values.

Experiment and find another calculation that gives a small numerical
error.


Mystery Operator
----------------
Java supports a special operator, `%`, which is called the **modulus
operator**.

Try some calculations using the modulus operator:

```
System.out.println(7 % 3);
System.out.println(12 % 5);
System.out.println(19 % 7);
```

Can you figure out what the mod operator does?

Hint: it has something to do with division.
