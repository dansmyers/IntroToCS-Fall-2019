## Comrades

Write a program that can read in a number of kilometers as input and print the corresponding number of miles. There are
1.60934 kilometers in one mile.

The Comrades Maraton in South Africa is the world's oldest and largest ultramrathon race, established in 1921. 
It is run between the cities of Durban and Pietermaritzburg in South Africa, a distance of about 87 km. 
25000 people are expected to participate in 2019. Interestingly, the direction of the race alternates every year,
with the course beginning in Durban being mostly uphill and the other direction being mostly downhill.

What is the length of Comrades Marathon in miles?

Tips:

- Use `nextInt` to read an integer number of kilometers from the terminal.

- Use a `final` variable to store the magic conversion number.

- Use `System.out.printf` and print the result to four decimal places.

## The Weight

Write a program to read in a weight in kilograms and convert it to pounds. There are about 2.20462 pounds in one kilogram.
Display the result to one decimal place.

The current world record for weight lifted overhead in the clean and jerk is 263.5 kg, held by Iranian superheavy
weightlifter / human vending machine [Hossein Rezazadeh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOE-PZJq2sk):

Use your program to calculate the weight of Rezazadeh's record lift in pounds.

Tip: you can use the `Scanner`'s `nextDouble` method to read a `double` value from the terminal.
